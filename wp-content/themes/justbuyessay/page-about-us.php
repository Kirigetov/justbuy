            <p>Our company has worked successfully in the field of academic assistance for over 10 years. We consistently upgrade our goals to improve the quality of service we provide and to maximize customer satisfaction. Success has driven us forward to an innovative concept. Our working experience, customer feedback, and market resources have brought about the creation of an exclusive online service: EssayAssistant.com.
            </p>
            <p>EssayAssistant.com is a unique on-line academic assistance service which allows customers and writers to work together towards a mutually-satisfying final product by communicating directly in chat with no involvement of a third party or support team. The advantages are obvious: our customers can manage their orders independently, from the first stage to the last. Working in the field of academic assistance for a reasonably a long period has brought us to the understanding that nobody can manage orders as effectively as our customers themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                With EssayAssistant.com:
                <ul>
                    <li>Customers decide which writer is best for each job, monitor and supervise writers'          work on orders, and make suggestions to help writers perfect their work to their full satisfaction.</li>
                    <li>Customers plan their own budget and choose a writer in line with the price requested for the job, the writer's CV, professional experience, and writing skills.</li>
                    <li>Customers evaluate writers' performance and share feedback with other users of the service to ensure writers' ratings are transparent and adequate.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>What's more, our customers do not need to commit to a writer or send any payment before they settle for a writer whose working approach resonates with them. Such an innovative approach allows us to create clear competition among our writers and motivates them to work at their best.</p>
            <p>First, our writers check instructions and deadlines of orders, and place their bids in accordance with the complexity and the urgency of particular orders. The system automatically adds a service fee and the total price is displayed to the customer. Then the customer is able to compare all of the bids that different writers suggest for their work, as well as get acquainted with each writer's level of cooperation and writing skills by watching him or her start working on the order. This way, a customer can settle for a particular writer whose approach to work and bid requested is most suitable for his or her needs.
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, we know that half of the process depends on customers and their ability to articulate instructions in an effective way. Their views on desired final products must be made clear to the writers. So, in an effort to encourage customers to communicate with writers in the best possible manner, we have invented the customer rating system. All our writers can rate their customers' level of cooperation with an order's successful completion, and writers too have the unique opportunity to choose the customer with whom they want to work.</p>
            <p>All in all, EssayAssistant.com offers a convenient, simple, and unique platform for collaboration between customers who struggle with their studying and professional writers willing and able to dedicate their skills towards customers' academic success. Our mission is to make both sides satisfied with the final product. We believe no other company on the market can offer a better solution to make that happen. Try now and decide for yourself!</p>
